# voxelquest

This is a restructuring of the VoxelQuest (https://www.voxelquest.com/) source code. It is currently in flux and only parts of it compile at the moment, but it is getting very close.

If you do decide to play with it be aware that it is setup to use hunter (https://github.com/cpp-pm/hunter). This means your first compile will download the current dependices and compile them. This may take some time as some of the dependencies are large (looking at you boost). This is a one time compile so after that the builds will be normal.
